            I am a positive and approachable individual with a passion for the
            whole stack and a specialized interest in frontend technology.
            Currently working as an IT-consultant based in Oslo, Norway Educated
            in Informatics - Design and Development of IT Systems from Ã˜stfold
            University College.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I have experience throughout the whole stack, from frontend
            development with React and TypeScript to mobile development with
            Flutter and React Native, and backend with .NET. I like both team
            environments and working independently, and I'm always eager to
            learn new technologies and concepts and talk to others about what I
            know.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Outside of my professional life, I'm an enthusiast of strength
            training. I also enjoy playing the guitar and am an avid gamer.
