            I am a positive and approachable individual with a passion for
            frontend development and a broad interest in the entire technology
            stack. Currently working as a consultant based in Oslo, Norway
            Educated in Informatics - Design and Development of IT Systems from
            Ã˜stfold University College, I have developed a strong expertise in
            responsive design and user-friendly solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My experience spans from frontend development with React and
            TypeScript to mobile development with Flutter and React Native. I
            thrive both in team environments and working independently, and I'm
            always eager to learn new technologies and concepts.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Outside of my professional life, I maintain a balanced lifestyle
            with diverse interests. I'm an enthusiast of strength training. I
            also enjoy playing the guitar. In my leisure time, I'm an avid
            gamer, and I find excitement and challenge in bouldering, which
            combines my love for physical activity with problem-solving skills.
