          I am in a small frontend team and we are currently leading the effort
          to revamp the frontend of multiple internal applications. The goal of
          this project is to improve the overall user experience and streamline
          the company's internal processes. To achieve this, I am utilizing
          Next.js 12 and legacy code where necessary, ensuring seamless
          integration with existing systems. Effective communication and
          collaboration are key to the success of this project, as I am working
          closely with different teams and PO's to understand their unique
          requirements and ensure that the frontend aligns with their goals. As
          the project progresses, I am continuously iterating and improving the
          frontend to deliver the best possible user experience. My role as a
          Frontend Developer on this project requires a combination of technical
          expertise, project management skills, and effective communication. By
          leveraging my knowledge of Next.js 12 and legacy code, and maintaining
          effective coordination with different teams and PO's, I am confident
          that we will achieve our goals for this project.

          I had the opportunity to work on the latest Bluetooth technology and
          design the frontend of the application. My job involved implementing
          new features, fixing bugs, and improving the overall user experience.
          During my six-month tenure, I worked closely with the app design and
          development team to ensure that the app was user-friendly and easy to
          navigate. I also tested the app on multiple devices and platforms to
          ensure its compatibility and performance. One of the key challenges I
          faced during the project was implementing the Bluetooth technology in
          the app, which required extensive research and testing to ensure its
          smooth functioning. I also had to design the app's frontend to ensure
          that it was visually appealing and easy to use. After months of hard
          work and dedication, I was able to successfully publish the SOS
          Sikkerhetsgruppen app on both the Google Play Store and Apple App
          Store. Overall, my six-month experience as a React-Native mobile
          developer on the SOS Sikkerhetsgruppen app was a valuable learning
          experience. I gained hands-on experience in implementing the latest
          technologies and honed my skills in app design and development. I am
          grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project and am
          looking forward to my next challenge in the field.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          During my time at Voglio, I was part of the team responsible for
          developing a flutter app called DigitalKey. My primary role was to
          work with the backend team to ensure that the app's requirements were
          met with new API solutions. Working on DigitalKey was an incredibly
          rewarding experience. I was able to use my skills in frontend
          development to make changes to the app's user interface and design. I
          also contributed drawings and suggestions to the overall design of the
          app, which helped to improve its usability and functionality. One of
          the biggest challenges I faced while working on DigitalKey was
          creating the authentication flow and making offline mode for the
          application. This required a lot of communication and collaboration,
          but ultimately, we were able to create a well-functioning app that was
          able to deliver on its promise. Overall, working on DigitalKey was a
          great learning experience for me. I was able to use my skills in
          frontend development and design to help create a useful and
          user-friendly app. Additionally, the experience of working with a team
          helped me to develop my communication and collaboration skills, which
          will be invaluable in my future work.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          As a part of my work experience with Paradisreiser, I was tasked with
          adding new features to the company's admin panel. To accomplish this,
          I utilized React and MUI as libraries to implement the necessary
          interface, logic, and functions that the customer requested. One of
          the key challenges I faced was ensuring that the new features were
          properly integrated with the backend, which was written in .NET. I
          spent a significant amount of time working with the backend to
          coordinate the integration and ensure that everything worked
          seamlessly. In addition to the new features for the admin panel, I
          also made adjustments to the company's mobile apps, which were written
          in Flutter for both Android and iOS. This involved implementing the
          same features that I had added to the admin panel, as well as making
          any necessary adjustments to ensure that the mobile apps were
          user-friendly and consistent with the overall design of the company's
          products. Overall, my work experience with Paradisreiser allowed me to
          hone my skills in React and MUI, as well as my ability to coordinate
          with other teams and ensure that the final product met the customer's
          expectations. I am proud of the work I did, and I believe that it made
          a significant contribution to the success of the company.
