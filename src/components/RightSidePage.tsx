          contracts for selling cars in Norway. The application is built using
          modern web technologies and best practices, showcasing my ability to
          create full-stack applications from scratch. Key features and
          technologies: - Built with Next.js 14, leveraging the latest features
          for optimal performance - Utilized the shadcn component library with
          Tailwind CSS for a polished UI - Implemented backend functionality
          using Supabase - Integrated Stripe for secure payment processing -
          Developed robust user authentication, including email verification and
          password recovery flows. It has already had real world usecases where
          people have used this service to sell cars. This project demonstrates
          my proficiency in creating end-to-end solutions, from frontend design
          to backend implementation and third-party integrations. I am
          interested in all of it!

          I had the opportunity to work on the latest Bluetooth technology and
          design the frontend of the application. My job involved implementing
          new features, fixing bugs, and improving the overall user experience.
          During my six-month tenure, I worked closely with the app design and
          development team to ensure that the app was user-friendly and easy to
          navigate. I also tested the app on multiple devices and platforms to
          ensure its compatibility and performance. One of the key challenges I
          faced during the project was implementing the Bluetooth technology in
          the app, which required extensive research and testing to ensure its
          smooth functioning. I also had to design the app's frontend to ensure
          that it was visually appealing and easy to use. After months of hard
          work and dedication, I was able to successfully publish the SOS
          Sikkerhetsgruppen app on both the Google Play Store and Apple App
          Store. Overall, my six-month experience as a React-Native mobile
          developer on the SOS Sikkerhetsgruppen app was a valuable learning
          experience. I gained hands-on experience in implementing the latest
          technologies and honed my skills in app design and development. I am
          grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project and am
          looking forward to my next challenge in the field.

          During my time at Voglio, I was part of the team responsible for
          developing a flutter app called DigitalKey. My primary role was to
          work with the backend team to ensure that the app's requirements were
          met with new API solutions. Working on DigitalKey was an incredibly
          rewarding experience. I was able to use my skills in frontend
          development to make changes to the app's user interface and design. I
          also contributed drawings and suggestions to the overall design of the
          app, which helped to improve its usability and functionality. One of
          the biggest challenges I faced while working on DigitalKey was
          creating the authentication flow and making offline mode for the
          application. This required a lot of communication and collaboration,
          but ultimately, we were able to create a well-functioning app that was
          able to deliver on its promise. Overall, working on DigitalKey was a
          great learning experience for me. I was able to use my skills in
          frontend development and design to help create a useful and
          user-friendly app. Additionally, the experience of working with a team
          helped me to develop my communication and collaboration skills, which
          will be invaluable in my future work.

          As a part of my work experience with Paradisreiser, I was tasked with
          adding new features to the company's admin panel. To accomplish this,
          I utilized React and MUI as libraries to implement the necessary
          interface, logic, and functions that the customer requested. One of
          the key challenges I faced was ensuring that the new features were
          properly integrated with the backend, which was written in .NET. I
          spent a significant amount of time working with the backend to
          coordinate the integration and ensure that everything worked
          seamlessly. In addition to the new features for the admin panel, I
          also made adjustments to the company's mobile apps, which were written
          in Flutter for both Android and iOS. This involved implementing the
          same features that I had added to the admin panel, as well as making
          any necessary adjustments to ensure that the mobile apps were
          user-friendly and consistent with the overall design of the company's
          products. Overall, my work experience with Paradisreiser allowed me to
          hone my skills in React and MUI, as well as my ability to coordinate

          expectations. I am proud of the work I did, and I believe that it made

          Here's a translation of the text into English, with some improvements

          Transport Ticketing This project involved developing an encryption
          solution for public transport ticketing for Entur, a Norwegian
          mobility company, through Capgemini. The primary objective was to
          encrypt the generation of electronic tickets and manage QR codes for
          physical tickets, all hosted on the Azure Cloud platform. Our team was
          responsible for implementing crucial security measures, including:
          Encryption and decryption processes Digital signature creation and
          verification Key management for securing information transferred
          between various system components The solution was built as a Spring
          Boot application, leveraging the Java Crypto API for cryptographic
          operations. We adopted a test-driven development (TDD) approach, which
          resulted in high test coverage through comprehensive unit testing and
          acceptance testing. Key aspects of the project: Utilized Azure Cloud
          for hosting and scalability Implemented robust security measures for
          sensitive ticketing data Ensured compliance with relevant data
          protection regulations Focused on creating a seamless and secure user
